SCC 0.3                                                 http://dev.zr40.nl/scc/


Installation instructions
=========================

SCC requires Python 2.6 and PLY.
The uploader/debugger also requires PySerial.

If your system does not already have Python 2.6 installed, you can download the
Python 2.6 installer from http://www.python.org/download/.

If your Python distribution does not come with easy_install, you can download
easy_install from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.

Windows users: after installing easy_install, add C:\Python26\Scripts (assuming
Python is installed in C:\Python26) to the PATH.

After installing Python and easy_install, install PLY and PySerial using
easy_install::

    easy_install ply
    easy_install pyserial

Optionally, you can add the SCC directory to the PATH. This allows you to use
scc.py, uploader.py and debugger.py easily in any directory.

Assembler
---------

The .asm files generated by SCC require the as504 assembler. asm504.com is not
supported!

as504 can be downloaded from http://www.vanwal.nl/as504/. Place the executable
in a directory in the PATH.

Windows-specific instructions
-----------------------------

The Windows build of as504 contains certain behavior which isn't present in
builds for other operating systems. For example, when done, it waits for an
enter key press. To work around this, a wrapper script (as504.py) is included.
